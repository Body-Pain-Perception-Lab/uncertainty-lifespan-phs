Perceptual illusions offer a window into the fundamental principles that shape everyday sensory experiences. Across modalities, they expose how the brain resolves ambiguity, reconciles conflicting cues, and infers meaning from incomplete or noisy inputs. In vision, classic illusions such as the Mach Band and the waterfall effect have highlighted mechanisms like lateral inhibition across the visual system [@anstis_motion_1998; @huk_neuronal_2001; @von_bekesy_mach-_1968; @ware_chromatic_1987]. In the somatosensory domain, phenomena such as the thermal grill illusion, the cutaneous rabbit, and referred sensations illustrate how tactile and thermal signals are integrated across time and space to construct coherent percepts [@craig_thermal_1994; @ehmsen_thermosensory_2025; @fardo_organization_2018; @geldard_cutaneous_1972; @katz_referred_1987; @mitchell_disentangling_2024; @schaldemose_when_2023].

Most empirical work on perceptual illusions has relied on forced-choice tasks, where participants categorise their experience in binary terms (i.e., the illusion is present or absent). While effective in identifying the stimulus conditions that give rise to illusory percepts, such paradigms often overlook the variability and uncertainty of the experience itself. This limitation is particularly evident for illusions that are variably expressed across individuals, occur over relatively long time periods, or are rooted in multisensory integration (e.g., the Thermal Grill or Rubber Hand illusions [@deolindo_assessing_2025; @haans_individual_2012]). To address this gap, we introduce a computational model that maps illusory percepts as a multivariate decision process, moving beyond binary categorisation. Our approach jointly models stimulus features with measures of perceptual uncertainty, quantified through trial-wise response times and confidence ratings, to characterise how individuals experience a thermosensory illusion known as Paradoxical Heat Sensation (PHS). 

PHS refers to the illusory experience of warmth during cooling, generated by temporally alternating warm and cold temperatures on the skin [@hamalainen_paradoxical_1982; @pavlicek_paradoxical_1933]. It is often described as an unusual experience and is more commonly reported in individuals with thermosensory deficits, including those associated with ageing and nerve damage [@baron_peripheral_2017; @hansen_paradoxical_1996; @magerl_reference_2010; @maier_quantitative_2010; @schaldemose_altered_2015; @vollert_paradoxical_2024; @yosipovitch_paradoxical_1995]. The probability of reporting PHS increases when the contrast between successive warm and cold temperatures is high, in young, healthy individuals [@mitchell_thermal_2024]. Whilst this finding provides a critical insight into the role of thermal contrast in PHS, it offers only a limited understanding into the perceptual experience itself, including ambiguity, subjective uncertainty and variability across individuals [@schaldemose_altered_2015; @schaldemose_it_2023; @vollert_paradoxical_2024]. For example, a report of warmth during cooling could reflect a true perceptual shift, or instead reflect a lack of clarity about the thermal quality with “warm” being the closest descriptor. Without additional behavioural markers to characterise this uncertainty, such distinctions remain inaccessible. 

To quantify illusory perception, we analysed perceptual binary choices (“cold” or “warm”) alongside the associated response times and confidence ratings. These trial-wise measures serve as behavioural proxies for decision latency and perceptual certainty. Incorporating them into a multivariate computational model allowed us to infer how thermosensory input is interpreted under uncertainty and how different perceptual profiles manifest across individuals.

We generated and tested two theoretical perceptual profiles to describe the PHS experience, and its link to thermal contrast: the “true perceiver” and the “unsure perceiver”. The “true perceiver” interprets PHS as a true illusion, where the perceiver experiences PHS as a sensation akin to veridical warmth. In this profile, perceptual uncertainty peaks near the PHS threshold, where the probability of experiencing PHS is around 50%. This is reflected by slower response times and lower confidence at thermal contrasts near the PHS threshold. In contrast, the “unsure perceiver” experiences PHS as an ambiguous sensation that is neither distinctly warm nor cold. For this profile, uncertainty increases monotonically with thermal contrast, peaking at high contrast levels where the probability of reporting PHS is highest. 

To evaluate these accounts, we implemented two computational models, each formalising one of the perceptual profiles, and tested their ability to quantify the perceptual uncertainty associated with PHS in our entire sample. The winning model was used to jointly assess the effects of thermal contrast and ageing on PHS, response time and confidence. Additionally, we examined the extent to which each model best explains the response profile of each individual. Crucially, this includes not only those who report PHS but also “non-responders” who never report the illusion. Our approach provides an in-depth characterisation of PHS experience, distinguishing between perceptual content, response dynamics and subjective uncertainty, in relation to stimulus properties and ageing, that is broadly applicable beyond thermosensation. The distinction between true and unsure perceivers may generalise to other domains involving ambiguous or unstable percepts, such as visual motion illusions, multisensory integration phenomena or clinical distortions of body perception. As such, this model provides a powerful tool for characterising individual differences in the construction of conscious sensory experience.
