	abstract = {Paradoxical heat sensation upon cooling of the skin has been reported in central as well as in peripheral neurological conditions. In our study, we examined this phenomenon in 35 naive healthy test subjects, of whom 23 experienced paradoxical heat sensation under test conditions. We measured the peripheral conduction velocities of cold sensation, warm sensation and of paradoxical heat sensation by using a quantitative sensory testing model of indirect peripheral conduction velocity measurement. This was based on comparison of measurements at a proximal and a distal site using two measurement methods, one inclusive and the other exclusive of reaction time. We found that the conduction velocity of paradoxical heat sensation (0.70 m/s) was similar to that of warm sensation (0.68 m/s), and that the conduction velocity of cold sensation (7.74–8.01 m/s) was considerably faster. Thus, we conclude that paradoxical heat sensation in healthy subjects is conducted peripherally via slow unmyelinated C fibres and not via the faster Aδ fibres. Consequently, we propose that paradoxical heat sensation is encoded via the heat sensing pathway, in accordance with the labelled-line code theory. The mechanisms proposed suggest a malfunctioning cold-sensing pathway disinhibiting the heat-sensing pathway, at peripheral, central or both levels, thus facilitating a paradoxical heat sensation.},

I the number of occurrences of sensation was studied in 19 naive test subjects (Ss) when cooling from thermal indifference both without and with preceding heating.

In Expt. II the effects of cooling velocity (velocities 0.4, 0.7 and 2.0 °C/s) and the type of skin area stimulated (hairy or glabrous skin of the hand) on the thresholds of paradoxical sensations were studied in 4 Ss without and with preheating. Cooling velocity, type of skin area and preheatting had significant effects on the sensation thresholds, the thresholds being the higher (i.e. the sensation appearing at lower stimulation temperatures) the higher the cooling velocity, if the stimuli were applied to the glabrous skin, or if no preheating was used. The results confirm the existence of paradoxical heat sensations during cooling of the skin and suggest that thesensation is mediated by polymodal units supplied by C-fibers.},

	abstract = {Heat and pain illusions (synthetic heat and the thermal grill illusion) can be generated by simultaneous cold and warm stimulation on the skin at temperatures that would normally be perceived as innocuous in isolation. Historically, two key questions have dominated the literature: which specific pathway conveys the illusory perceptions of heat and pain, and where, specifically, does the illusory pain originate in the central nervous system? Two major theories – the addition and disinhibition theories – have suggested distinct pathways, as well as specific spinal or supraspinal mechanisms. However, both theories fail to fully explain experimental findings on illusory heat and pain phenomena. We suggest that the disagreement between previous theories and experimental evidence can be solved by abandoning the assumption of one-to-one relations between pathways and perceived qualities. We argue that a population coding framework, based on distributed activity across non-nociceptive and nociceptive pathways, offers a more powerful explanation of illusory heat and pain. This framework offers new hypotheses regarding the neural mechanisms underlying temperature and pain perception.},

	abstract = {Objective A common symptom of neuropathy is the misperception of heat and pain from cold stimuli. Similar cold allodynic sensations can be experimentally induced using the thermal grill illusion (TGI) in humans. It is currently unclear whether this interaction between thermosensory and nociceptive signals depends on spinal or supraspinal integration mechanisms. To address this issue, we developed a noninvasive protocol to assess thermosensory integration across spinal segments. Methods We leveraged anatomical knowledge regarding dermatomes and their spinal projections to investigate potential contributions of spinal integration to the TGI. We simultaneously stimulated a pair of skin locations on the arm or lower back using 1 cold (∼20°C) and 1 warm thermode (∼40°C). The 2 thermodes were always separated by a fixed physical distance on the skin, but elicited neural activity across a varying number of spinal segments, depending on which dermatomal boundaries the 2 stimuli spanned. Results Participants consistently overestimated the actual cold temperature on the skin during combined cold and warm stimulation, confirming the TGI effect. The TGI was present when cold and warm stimuli were delivered within the same dermatome, or across dermatomes corresponding to adjacent spinal segments. In striking contrast, no TGI effect was found when cold and warm stimuli projected to nonadjacent spinal segments. Interpretation These results demonstrate that the strength of the illusion is modulated by the segmental distance between cold and warm afferents. This suggests that both temperature perception and thermal–nociceptive interactions depend upon low-level convergence mechanisms operating within a single spinal segment and its immediate neighbors.

	abstract = {In the social sciences it is common practice to test specific theoretically motivated research hypotheses using formal statistical procedures. Typically, students in these disciplines are trained in such methods starting at an early stage in their academic tenure. On the other hand, in psychophysical research, where parameter estimates are generally obtained using a maximum-likelihood (ML) criterion and data do not lend themselves well to the least-squares methods taught in introductory courses, it is relatively uncommon to see formal model comparisons performed. Rather, it is common practice to estimate the parameters of interest (e.g., detection thresholds) and their standard errors individually across the different experimental conditions and to 'eyeball' whether the observed pattern of parameter estimates supports or contradicts some proposed hypothesis. We believe that this is at least in part due to a lack of training in the proper methodology as well as a lack of available software to perform such model comparisons when ML estimators are used. We introduce here a relatively new toolbox of Matlab routines called Palamedes which allows users to perform sophisticated model comparisons. In Palamedes, we implement the model-comparison approach to hypothesis testing. This approach allows researchers considerable flexibility in targeting specific research hypotheses. We discuss in a non-technical manner how this method can be used to perform statistical model comparisons when ML estimators are used. With Palamedes we hope to make sophisticated statistical model comparisons available to researchers who may not have the statistical background or the programming skills to perform such model comparisons from scratch. Note that while Palamedes is specifically geared toward psychophysical data, the core ideas behind the model-comparison approach that our paper discusses generalize to any field in which statistical hypotheses are tested.},

	abstract = {A paradoxical heat sensation (PHS) is the misperception of warmth when the skin is cooled. PHS is uncommon in healthy individuals but common in patients with neuropathy and is associated with reduced thermal sensitivity. Identifying conditions that contribute to PHS may indirectly help us understand why some patients experience PHS. We hypothesized that pre-warming increased the number of PHS and that pre-cooling had minimal effect on PHS. We tested 100 healthy participants' thermal sensitivity on the dorsum of their feet by measuring detection and pain thresholds to cold and warm stimuli and PHS. PHS was measured using the thermal sensory limen (TSL) procedure from the quantitative sensory testing protocol of the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain and by using a modified TSL protocol (mTSL). In the mTSL we examined the participants' thermal detection and PHS after pre-warming of 38°C and 44°C and pre-cooling of 26°C and 20°C. Compared to a baseline condition, the number of PHS responders was significantly increased after pre-cooling (20°C: RR = 1.9 (1.1; 3.3), p = 0.023 and 26°C: RR = 1.9 (1.2; 3.2), p = 0.017), but not significantly after pre-warming (38°C: RR = 1.5 (0.86; 2.8), p = 0.21 and 44°C: RR = 1.7 (.995; 2.9), p = 0.078). Pre-warming and pre-cooling increased the detection threshold of both cold and warm temperatures. We discussed these findings in relation to thermal sensory mechanisms and possible PHS mechanisms. In conclusion, PHS and thermosensation are closely related and pre-cooling can induce PHS responses in healthy individuals.},

Despite its initial documentation over 100 years ago, a unified explanation for this perplexing experience remains elusive. Here we apply contrast enhancement principles, known for their instrumental role in understanding visual illusions, to the domain of thermosensation. Contrast enhancement describes the amplification of two contrasting visual features, such as the enhanced perception of an edge between a light and dark bar. In thermosensation, this encompasses an enhancement of the difference between sequential warming and cooling of the skin, and is defined as the normalised difference between successive temporal warm and cold temperatures. Remarkably, thermal contrast predicts the occurrence of PHS. Our findings reveal compelling evidence supporting the role of thermal contrast in the generation of PHS, shedding light on its underlying mechanism and offering a framework for broader encoding principles in thermosensation and pain.},

However, the use of experimental pain sensitivity assessment on a broad scale is hampered by its requirements on time, equipment and human resources and the fact that it is painful for the tested subject. Alternatives to experimental pain testing are currently lacking. Here we developed a self-rating instrument for the assessment of pain sensitivity, the Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire (PSQ) that is based on pain intensity ratings of daily life situations and takes 5-10min to complete. Adequate reliability of the PSQ was confirmed in 354 subjects. In a validation study comprising 47 healthy subjects, the results of comprehensive experimental pain testing, including different modalities (heat, cold, pressure, and pinprick) and different measures (pain thresholds, pain intensity ratings), were compared to the results of the PSQ. PSQ scores were significantly correlated to experimental pain intensity ratings (r = 0.56, p {\textless} 0.001) but not to pain thresholds (r = 0.03). Prediction of experimental pain intensity ratings by the PSQ was better than by pain-associated psychological factors (pain catastrophizing, depression, anxiety). This shows that the PSQ may be a simple alternative to experimental pain intensity rating procedures in healthy subjects and makes the PSQ a highly promising tool for clinical and experimental pain research.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE
While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity.

MEASUREMENTS
The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as “0” (not at all) to “3” (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients.

RESULTS
As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score ≥10 had a sensitivity of 88\% and a specificity of 88\% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples.

CONCLUSION
In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

	abstract = {There seem to be two different types of lateral inhibition in vision. One occurs very close to the edge of a step in luminance distribution. This lateral inhibition produces an overshoot and undershoot, and is called the Mach-type of inhibition. A second type of inhibition covers a much larger area, and produces a gradual slope in brightness. This is called the Hering-type inhibition. Experiments indicate that these two types of inhibition show many differences. A previously described neural unit, for the description of brightness distributions produced by luminance patterns, was improved to combine both types of inhibition.
Résumé
Il semble exister deux types différents d'inhibition latérale en vision. L'une se produit tout près du bord d'une discontinuitédans la distribution de luminance. Cette inhibition latérale produit une augmentation et une diminution, et s'appelle l'inhibition type Mach. L'autre type d'inhibition couvre une aire plus grande et produit une variation graduelle de luminosité. On l'appelle inhibition du type Hering. Les expériences montrent que ces deux types d'inhibition présentent beaucoup de différences. Une uniténerveuse, précédemment décrite pour interpréter les distributions de luminositéproduites par des tests lumineux, aétéaméliorée pour combiner les deux types d'inhibition.
Zusammenfassung
Beim Sehen scheint es zwei verschiedene Arten lateraler Inhibition zu geben. Eine tritt sehr nahe der Kante bei einer stufenförmigen Helligkeitsverteilung auf. Diese laterale Inhibition zeigtÜberschwingen und Unterschwingen und heiβt Machsche Inhibition. Eine zweite Art von Inhibition trittüber eine viel gröβere Fläche auf und bewirkt einen allmählichen Helligkeitsabfall. Dies bezeichnet man als Heringsche Inhibition. Aus Experimenten ergibt sich, daβ diese beiden Arten von Inhibition viele Unterschiede aufweisen. Eine vorhergehend beschriebene neurale Einheit für die Beschreibung von Helligkeitsverteilungen, die durch Leuchtdichtemuster erzeugt werden, wurde verbessert, um beide Arten von Inhibition darzustellen.

	abstract = {The LISSOM (Laterally Interconnected Synergetically Self-Organizing Map) model has previously been used to simulate the development of primary visual cortex (V1) maps for orientation and motion processing. In this work, we show that the same self-organizing processes driving the long-term development of the map result in illusory motion over short time scales in the adult. After adaptation to a moving stimulus, the model exhibits both motion aftereffects (illusory motion for a static test pattern, also known as the waterfall illusion or MAE) and the direction aftereffect (systematic changes in direction perception for moving test patterns, the DAE). Together with previous results replicating the tilt afferefect (TAE) for stationary patterns, these results suggest that a relatively simple computational process underlies common orientation and motion aftereffects. The model predicts that such effects are caused by adaptation of lateral connections between neurons selective for motion direction and orientation.},

	abstract = {In the Thermal Grill Illusion (TGI), the spatial alternation of non-noxious warm and cool temperatures elicits burning sensations that resemble the presence of noxious stimuli. Previous research has largely relied on the use of specific temperature values (i.e., 20 °C and 40 °C) to study this phenomenon in both healthy individuals and patient populations. However, this methodology fails to account for inter-individual differences in thermal sensitivity, limiting the precision with which TGI responses can be evaluated across diverse populations. To address this gap, we created a Two-Dimensional Thermal Grill Calibration (2D-TGC) protocol, enabling an efficient and precise estimation of the combinations of warm and cool temperatures needed to elicit burning sensations tailored to each individual. By applying the 2D-TGC protocol in 43 healthy participants, we demonstrated that the TGI can be thresholded using an adaptive psychophysical method, and that multiple combinations of warm and cool temperatures can elicit this phenomenon. More specifically, the protocol facilitated the identification of temperature combinations that elicit TGI with varying levels of probability, intensity, and perceived quality ranging from freezing cold to burning hot. Finally, our results indicate that TGI responsivity can be quantified as a continuous variable, moving beyond the conventional classification of individuals as responders vs. non-responders based on arbitrary temperature values in the innocuous temperature range. The 2D-TGC offers a comprehensive approach to investigate the TGI across populations with altered thermal sensitivity, and can be integrated with other methods (e.g., neuroimaging) to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for perceptual illusions in the thermo-nociceptive system.
Perspective
This study reveals that the Thermal Grill Illusion can be accurately measured using psychophysical methods. The innovative Two-Dimensional Thermal Grill Calibration protocol allows for personalized temperature assessments, enhancing our understanding of thermal sensitivity variations and perceptual illusions in the thermo-nociceptive system across different populations.},

The origins of these perceptual space-time distortions are unknown.Methodology/Principal FindingsHere I show that these illusory effects, which I term perceptual length contraction and time dilation, are emergent properties of a Bayesian observer model that incorporates prior expectation for speed. Rapidly moving stimuli violate expectation, provoking perceptual length contraction and time dilation. The Bayesian observer replicates the cutaneous rabbit illusion, the tau effect, the kappa effect, and other spatiotemporal illusions. Additionally, it shows realistic tactile temporal order judgment and spatial attention effects.Conclusions/SignificanceThe remarkable explanatory power of this simple model supports the hypothesis, first proposed by Helmholtz, that the brain biases perception in favor of expectation. Specifically, the results suggest that the brain automatically incorporates prior expectation for speed in order to overcome spatial and temporal imprecision inherent in the sensorineural signal.},

To explore the spectrum of sensory abnormalities, 1236 patients with a clinical diagnosis of neuropathic pain were assessed by quantitative sensory testing (QST) following the protocol of DFNS (German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain), using both thermal and mechanical nociceptive as well as non-nociceptive stimuli. Data distributions showed a systematic shift to hyperalgesia for nociceptive, and to hypoesthesia for non-nociceptive parameters. Across all parameters, 92\% of the patients presented at least one abnormality. Thermosensory or mechanical hypoesthesia (up to 41\%) was more frequent than hypoalgesia (up to 18\% for mechanical stimuli). Mechanical hyperalgesias occurred more often (blunt pressure: 36\%, pinprick: 29\%) than thermal hyperalgesias (cold: 19\%, heat: 24\%), dynamic mechanical allodynia (20\%), paradoxical heat sensations (18\%) or enhanced wind-up (13\%). Hyperesthesia was less than 5\%. Every single sensory abnormality occurred in each neurological syndrome, but with different frequencies: thermal and mechanical hyperalgesias were most frequent in complex regional pain syndrome and peripheral nerve injury, allodynia in postherpetic neuralgia. In postherpetic neuralgia and in central pain, subgroups showed either mechanical hyperalgesia or mechanical hypoalgesia. The most frequent combinations of gain and loss were mixed thermal/mechanical loss without hyperalgesia (central pain and polyneuropathy), mixed loss with mechanical hyperalgesia in peripheral neuropathies, mechanical hyperalgesia without any loss in trigeminal neuralgia. Thus, somatosensory profiles with different combinations of loss and gain are shared across the major neuropathic pain syndromes. The characterization of underlying mechanisms will be needed to make a mechanism-based classification feasible.},

	abstract = {Background Quantitative sensory testing of thermal detection abilities is used as a clinical tool to assess the function of pain pathways. The most common procedure to assess thermal sensitivity, the ‘method of limits’, provides a quick but rough estimate of detection thresholds. Here, we investigate the potential of evaluating not only the threshold but also the slope of the psychometric functions for cold and warm detection. Method A convenience sample of 15 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and 15 age-matched healthy controls (HC) was tested. Thirty brief (100 ms) stimuli of each modality were applied to the volar wrist and foot dorsum. Cold and warm stimuli were delivered with a Peltier thermode and a temperature-controlled CO2 laser, respectively. Stimulus intensities were dynamically selected using an adaptive Bayesian algorithm (psi method) maximizing information gain for threshold and slope estimation. ROC analyses were used to assess the ability of slopes, thresholds and the combination of both to discriminate between groups. Results Assessment of the slope and threshold of the psychometric function for thermal detection took about 10 min. The ability to detect warmth was not reduced in DM patients as compared to HC. Cold detection performance assessed using slope or threshold parameters separated DM from HC with good discriminative power. Discrimination was further increased when both parameters were used together (93\% sensitivity and 87\% specificity), indicating that they provide complementary information on patient status. Conclusion The psi method may be an interesting alternative to the classical method of limits for thermal QST. Significance Current QST protocols provide an incomplete and potentially biased estimate of sensory detection performance. We propose a method that estimates the slope and the threshold of the psychometric function, defining heat and cold sensory detection performance, in only a few minutes. Furthermore, we provide preliminary evidence that combining slope and threshold parameters of cold detection performance leads to a better discriminative ability than relying solely on the threshold.},

The outstanding abnormality in sensory quality was perception of heat in response to low temperature stimuli. This paradoxical heat sensation was found in the foot in 42\% (15) of patients, far beyond the normal prevalence of 10\%. Paradoxical sensation was positively related to cold hypoesthesia (P = 0.0004) suggesting disinhibition as a possible mechanism. Paradoxical heat sensation also positively related to creatinine level (P = 0.0012). Pruritus was present in 20 patients (56\%), intensity not related to any biochemical or clinical parameter. Signs of sensory polyneuropathy (PNP), based on at least two abnormal parameters in the clinical assessment or QST, were found in 39\% of patients (14), of whom 11 had paradoxical heat sensation. Thus, in 4 patients (11\%), this sensory aberration preceded other signs for PNP.

Using simplified instructions and response options, the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory was administered on a sample of 1514 participants using an online questionnaire. In accordance with previous research, a model of the 10-item inventory had poor fit for the data. This study also detected model misspecification in the previously-proposed 7-item modification. A 4-item Edinburgh Handedness Inventory – Short Form had good model fit with items modelled as both continuous and ordinal. Despite its brevity, it showed very good reliability, factor score determinacy, and correlation with scores on the 10-item inventory. By eliminating items that were modelled with considerable measurement error, the short form alleviates the concern of the 10-item inventory over-categorising mixed handers. Evidence was found for factorial invariance across level of education, age groups, and regions (USA and Australia/New Zealand). There generally appeared to be invariance across genders for the 4-item inventory. The proposed Edinburgh Handedness Inventory – Short Form measures a single handedness factor with an inventory that has brief and simple instructions and a small number of items.},

	abstract = {Diabet. Med. 29, 937–944 (2012) Abstract Aims The Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI) is used to assess distal symmetrical peripheral neuropathy in diabetes. It includes two separate assessments: a 15-item self-administered questionnaire and a lower extremity examination that includes inspection and assessment of vibratory sensation and ankle reflexes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the MNSI in detecting distal symmetrical peripheral neuropathy in patients with Type 1 diabetes and to develop new scoring algorithms. Methods The MNSI was performed by trained personnel at each of the 28 Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications clinical sites. Neurologic examinations and nerve conduction studies were performed during the same year. Confirmed clinical neuropathy was defined by symptoms and signs of distal symmetrical peripheral neuropathy based on the examination of a neurologist and abnormal nerve conduction findings in ≥ 2 anatomically distinct nerves among the sural, peroneal and median nerves. Results We studied 1184 subjects with Type 1 diabetes. Mean age was 47 years and duration of diabetes was 26 years. Thirty per cent of participants had confirmed clinical neuropathy, 18\% had ≥ 4 and 5\% had ≥ 7 abnormal responses on the MNSI questionnaire, and 33\% had abnormal scores (≥ 2.5) on the MNSI examination. New scoring algorithms were developed and cut points defined to improve the performance of the MNSI questionnaire, examination and the combination of the two. Conclusions Altering the cut point to define an abnormal test from ≥ 7 abnormal to ≥ 4 abnormal items improves the performance of the MNSI questionnaire. The MNSI is a simple, non-invasive and valid measure of distal symmetrical peripheral neuropathy in Type 1 diabetes.},

	abstract = {Paradoxical heat sensation (PHS) is the perception of warmth when the skin is cooled. Paradoxical heat sensation rarely occurs in healthy individuals but more frequently in patients suffering from lesions or disease of the peripheral or central nervous system. To further understand mechanisms and epidemiology of PHS, we evaluated the occurrence of PHS in relation to disease aetiology, pain levels, quantitative sensory testing parameters, and Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) items in patients with nervous system lesions. Data of 1090 patients, including NPSI scores from 404 patients, were included in the analysis. We tested 11 quantitative sensory testing parameters for thermal and mechanical detection and pain thresholds, and 10 NPSI items in a multivariate generalised linear model with PHS, aetiology, and pain (yes or no) as fixed effects. In total, 30\% of the neuropathic patients reported PHS in contrast to 2\% of healthy individuals. The frequency of PHS was not linked to the presence or intensity of pain. Paradoxical heat sensation was more frequent in patients living with polyneuropathy compared with central or unilateral peripheral nerve lesions. Patients who reported PHS demonstrated significantly lower sensitivity to thermal perception, with lower sensitivity to normally painful heat and cold stimuli. Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory scores were lower for burning and electric shock–like pain quality for patients with PHS. Our findings suggest that PHS is associated with loss of small thermosensory fibre function normally involved in cold and warm perception. Clinically, presence of PHS could help screening for loss of small fibre function as it is straightforward to measure or self-reported by patients.},

To evaluate this question, we conducted quantitative and qualitative somatosensory testing in spinal cord injury subjects who suffered from partial or complete loss of thermal sensibility. Testing was performed in skin areas, below the level of the lesion, which were either lacking any thermal sensibility, lacking only one thermal sensation (either heat or cold) or having normal thermal sensations. We found that, in areas lacking any thermal sensibility, warm and cold stimuli produced a sensation of pricking pain, which had no thermal quality and was detected at significantly higher thresholds than in normal controls (48.5 ± 1.8 and 9.7 ± 5.1°C for noxious heat‐ and noxious cold‐induced pricking pain, respectively). Normal thermal pain sensations, consisting of normal perception of thermal quality and normal mean pain thresholds, were present both in normal skin areas (42.1 ± 1.9 and 27.6 ± 2.25°C for heat and cold pain, respectively) and in areas in which only one thermal modality remained intact, when tested for that modality. Thus, testing for heat pain in areas in which only warm sensation was intact, or cold pain when only cold was intact produced normal qualities and thresholds of pain (42.8 ± 3.4 and 24.4 ± 6.2°C for heat and cold pain, respectively). No spatial summation of pricking pain was observed, in contrast to the marked summation of heat pain in normal areas. In areas with only a single intact thermal modality, the quality of the perceived non‐painful sensation was not determined by the thermal stimulus but by the intact modality (paradoxical sensation). Cold stimuli were perceived as warm in areas in which only warm sensation was preserved, and vice versa. A similar pattern was also seen for pain perception in areas with intact warm sensation. In these areas, both noxious heat and cold elicited a sensation of heat pain. No consistent pattern of heat‐elicited pain was observed in areas in which only cold sensation was intact. These data suggest that the integrity of non‐noxious thermal systems is essential for the normal perception of thermal pain, and that the subjective sensation of pain depends on the integration of information from nociceptive and non‐nociceptive channels.},

In this research, we develop such an instrument using Rasch-type models. In our conception, incorporating an object (e.g., a rubber hand) into one's body image requires various sensorimotor and cognitive processes. The extent to which people can meet these requirements thus determines how intensely people experience and, simultaneously, describe the illusion. As a consequence, individual differences in people's susceptibility to the rubber-hand illusion can be determined by inspecting reports of their personal experiences. The proposed model turned out to be functional in its capability to predict self-reports of people's experiences and to reliably assess individual differences in susceptibility to the illusion. Regarding validity, we found a small, but significant, correlation between individual susceptibility and proprioceptive drift. Additionally, we found that asynchrony, and tapping rather than stroking the fingers constrain the experience of the illusion.},

	abstract = {In the rubber hand illusion (RHI), watching a rubber hand being stroked in synchrony with one’s own hidden hand may induce a sense of ownership over the rubber hand. The illusion relies on bottom-up multisensory integration of visual, tactile, and proprioceptive information, and on top-down processes through which the rubber hand is incorporated into pre-existing representations of the body. Although the degree of illusory experience varies largely across individuals, the factors influencing individual differences are unknown. We investigated whether sensory suggestibility might modulate susceptibility to the RHI. Sensory suggestibility is a personality trait related to how individuals react to sensory information. Because of its sensory nature, this trait could be relevant for studies using the RHI paradigm. Seventy healthy volunteers were classified by Sensory Suggestibility Scale (SSS) scores as having high or low suggestibility and assigned to either a high- (High-SSS) or a low-suggestibility (Low-SSS) group. Two components of the RHI were evaluated in synchronous and asynchronous stroking conditions: subjective experience of sense of ownership over the rubber hand via a 9-statement questionnaire, and proprioceptive drift as measured with a ruler. The High-SSS group was generally more susceptible to the subjective component; in the synchronous condition, they rated the statement assessing the sense of ownership higher than the Low-SSS group. The scores for this statement significantly correlated with the total SSS score, indicating that the higher the sensory suggestibility, the stronger the sense of ownership. No effect of sensory suggestibility on proprioceptive drift was observed, suggesting that the effect is specific for the subjective feeling of ownership. This study demonstrates that sensory suggestibility may contribute to participants’ experience of the illusion and should be considered when using the RHI paradigm.},

	abstract = {Vision scientists have tried to classify illusions for more than a century. For example, some studies suggested that there is a unique common factor for all visual illusions. Other studies proposed that there are several subclasses of illusions, such as illusions of linear extent or distortions. We previously observed strong within-illusion correlations but only weak between-illusion correlations, arguing in favor of an even higher multifactorial space with—more or less—each illusion making up its own factor. These mixed results are surprising. Here, we examined to what extent individual differences in the perception of visual illusions are stable across eyes, time, and measurement methods. First, we did not find any significant differences in the magnitudes of the seven illusions tested with monocular or binocular viewing conditions. In addition, illusion magnitudes were not significantly predicted by visual acuity. Second, we observed stable individual differences over time. Last, we compared two illusion measurements, namely an adjustment procedure and a method of constant stimuli, which both led to similar individual differences. Hence, it is unlikely that the individual differences in the perception of visual illusions arise from instability across eyes, time, and measurement methods.},

The general relationship suggested that higher levels of spatial ability were associated with reduced illusion magnitude; however, a canonical correlation analysis revealed that the direction of this relationship depended on the type of illusion. Illusions of linear extent showed an inverse relationship between the two sets of measures, with higher levels of spatial abilities associated with lower degrees of illusion susceptibility.

The illusory ownership or agency arising from the hand correlated with that of the finger.

The German research network on neuropathic pain (DFNS) solves this problem by defining reference data stratified for test site, gender and age for a standardized QST protocol. In this report we have targeted two further problems: how to adjust for age-related sensory changes, and how to compare groups of patients with the reference database. We applied a moving average across ages to define reference values per decade. This analysis revealed that women were more sensitive to heat pain independent of age. In contrast, functions were converging at older age for blunt pressure pain, but diverging for punctate mechanical pain (pin prick). The probability that an individual patient dataset is within the range of normal variability is calculated by z-transform using site-, gender- and age-specific reference data. To compare groups of patients with reference data, we evaluated two techniques: A: paired t-test versus fixed mean; i.e. the reference mean value is considered as the known population mean, B: non-paired t-test versus the reference dataset and number of cases restrained to the same number of cases as the patient data set. Simulations for various sample sizes and variances showed that method B was more conservative than method A. We present a simple way of calculating method B for data that have been z-normalized. This technique makes the DFNS reference data bank applicable for researchers beyond the DFNS community without a need for subsampling of subjects from the database.},

We find that these expectations directly modulate the perception of pain in the thermal grill illusion. Quantitative microstructural brain imaging further revealed that individual variability in computational parameters related to uncertainty-driven learning and decision-making is reflected in the microstructure of brain regions such as the precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, cerebellum, as well as basal ganglia and brainstem.

We applied heat and cold stimuli to dermatomes, areas of skin innervated by a single spinal nerve, that mapped onto adjacent or nonadjacent spinal segments. Enhanced warm and burning ratings during the TGI were observed when cold and warm stimuli were confined within the same dermatome. Furthermore, we found the spatial organisation of warm and cold stimuli within and across dermatomes affected TGI perception. Perceived warmth and burning intensity increased when the cold stimulus projected to the segment more caudal to the warm stimulus, whereas perceived cold during the TGI decreased compared with the opposite spatial arrangement. This suggests that the perception of TGI is enhanced when cold afferents are projected to spinal segments positioned caudally in relation to those receiving warm afferents. Our results indicate distinct interaction of sensory pathways based on the segmental arrangement of afferent fibres and are consistent with current interpretations of the spread and integration of thermosensory information along the spinal cord.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel distributional regression model for a multivariate response vector based on a copula process over the covariate space. It uses the implicit copula of a Gaussian multivariate regression, which we call a ``regression copula''. To allow for large covariate vectors their coefficients are regularized using a novel multivariate extension of the horseshoe prior. Bayesian inference and distributional predictions are evaluated using efficient variational inference methods, allowing application to large datasets. An advantage of the approach is that the marginal distributions of the response vector can be estimated separately and accurately, resulting in predictive distributions that are marginally-calibrated. Two substantive applications of the methodology highlight its efficacy in multivariate modeling. The first is the econometric modeling and prediction of half-hourly regional Australian electricity prices. Here, our approach produces more accurate distributional forecasts than leading benchmark methods. The second is the evaluation of multivariate posteriors in likelihood-free inference (LFI) of a model for tree species abundance data, extending a previous univariate regression copula LFI method. In both applications, we demonstrate that our new approach exhibits a desirable marginal calibration property.},

	abstract = {Paradoxical heat sensation (PHS) and the thermal grill illusion (TGI) are both related to the perception of warmth or heat from innocuous cold stimuli. Despite being described as similar perceptual phenomena, recent findings suggested that PHS is common in neuropathy and related to sensory loss, while TGI is more frequently observed in healthy individuals. To clarify the relationship between these two phenomena, we conducted a study in a cohort of healthy individuals to investigate the association between PHS and TGI. We examined the somatosensory profiles of 60 healthy participants (34 females, median age 25 years) using the quantitative sensory testing (QST) protocol from the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain. The number of PHS was measured using a modified thermal sensory limen (TSL) procedure where the skin was transiently pre-warmed, or pre-cooled before the PHS measure. This procedure also included a control condition with a pre-temperature of 32 °C. The number of TGI responses was quantified during simultaneous application of warm and cold innocuous stimuli. All participants had normal thermal and mechanical thresholds compared to the reference values from the QST protocol. Only two participants experienced PHS during the QST procedure. In the modified TSL procedure, we found no statistically significant differences in the number of participants reporting PHS in the control condition (N = 6) vs. pre-warming (N = 3; min = 35.7 °C, max = 43.5 °C) and pre-cooling (N = 4, min = 15.0 °C, max = 28.8 °C) conditions. Fourteen participants experienced TGI, and only one participant reported both TGI and PHS. Individuals with TGI had normal or even increased thermal sensation compared to individuals without TGI. Our findings demonstrate a clear distinction between individuals experiencing PHS or TGI, as there was no overlap observed when using identical warm and cold temperatures that were alternated either temporally or spatially. While PHS was previously related to sensory loss, our study revealed that TGI is associated with normal thermal sensitivity. This suggests that an efficient thermal sensory function is essential in generating the illusory sensation of pain of the TGI.},

Paradoxical heat sensation is a pathological sign associated with neuropathy, eg, diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN). The aim of this study was to examine whether specific characteristics in the sensory nervous system are associated with PHS and to evaluate whether PHS is a predictor of thermal sensory loss or neuropathy. Using baseline and 5-year follow-up data from a study on patients with type 2 diabetes, we analyzed the relationship between PHS and sensory and neurophysiological parameters, assessed with quantitative sensory testing (QST), nerve conduction studies, and skin biopsy measures. A total of 420 individuals was included. Sixty-two individuals had diabetes without DPN, 263 had DPN of which 89 had painful DPN, and 95 were controls without diabetes. At baseline, the frequency of PHS was higher in patients with DPN (51\%) than in controls (32\%, P = 0.001, Pearson χ2 test), but there were no differences between patients with diabetes with and without DPN or between those with painful vs painless DPN (both P ≥ 0.085). Among individuals with normal baseline thermal sensation (defined from the QST normative material) (n = 161), PHS at baseline was associated with thermal sensory loss at follow-up (χ2 = 4.7, P = 0.03, logistic regression, joint test, adjusted for sex, age, and neuropathy status). Across all groups, participants with PHS exhibited thermal sensory loss. This is the first longitudinal study on PHS. We confirmed that PHS is related to thermal sensory loss. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PHS is an early marker of thermal sensory loss, which may have therapeutic or prophylactic implications.},

A significant proportion of the patients had thresholds outside the 2.5 SD range for normal subjects, both for warmth detection threshold and TSL. In addition, 10 patients with probable or definite multiple sclerosis and one patient with possible multiple sclerosis reported a paradoxical heat sensation, i.e. a sensation of warmth elicited by a cold stimulus. This illusion was almost exclusively observed with the alternating warm and cold stimuli of the TSL procedure. In contrast to experimental nerve block or peripheral demyelinating neuropathy, where paradoxical heat sensation has been described by various authors, in the patients with multiple sclerosis the demyelination sites were located in the central nervous system. The observation that multiple sclerosis patients had paradoxical heat sensation in addition to threshold abnormalities supports the view that supraspinal sites are important for the integration of temperature sensation.},

This region was suppressed during mild skin cooling. We propose that this differential response is a manifestation of the role of the insula in signaling temperature perceptions regardless of the actual temperature of the skin. These findings suggest that a region within the insula has a complex role in heat perception, perhaps contributing to a specific, rather than general, thermosensory perception.

	abstract = {"Synthetic heat", also known as the heat grill illusion, occurs when contact with spatially adjacent warm and cold stimuli produce a sensation of "heat". This phenomenon has been explained as a painful perception that occurs when warm stimulation inhibits cold-sensitive neurons in the spinothalamic tract (STT), which in turn unmasks activity in the pain pathway caused by stimulation of C-polymodal nociceptors (CPNs). The "unmasking model" was tested in experiment 1 by combining warm (35-40°C) and cool ( S 27°C) stimuli that were too mild to stimulate CPNs. After discovering that these temperatures produced nonpainful heat, experiment 2 was designed to determine whether heat could be induced when near-threshold cooling was paired with mild warmth, and whether lowering the base temperature for cooling would increase the noxious (burning, stinging) components of heat for fixed cooling steps of 1-3°C. Cooling by just 1°C from a base temperature of 33°C led to reports of heat on more than 1/3 of trials, and cooling by just 3°C evoked heat on 75\% of trials. Lowering the base temperature to 31 or 29°C increased reports of heat and burning but did not produce significant reports of pain. Perception of nonpainful heat at such mild temperatures indicates either that cold-sensitive nociceptors with thresholds very similar to cold fibers innervate hairy skin in humans, or that heat can result from integration of warm fiber and cold fiber activity, perhaps via convergence on nonspecific (e.g., WDR) neurons in the STT.},

Paradoxical heat sensation rarely occurs in healthy individuals but more frequently in patients suffering from lesions or disease of the peripheral or central nervous system. To further understand mechanisms and epidemiology of PHS, we evaluated the occurrence of PHS in relation to disease aetiology, pain levels, quantitative sensory testing parameters, and Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) items in patients with nervous system lesions. Data of 1090 patients, including NPSI scores from 404 patients, were included in the analysis. We tested 11 quantitative sensory testing parameters for thermal and mechanical detection and pain thresholds, and 10 NPSI items in a multivariate generalised linear model with PHS, aetiology, and pain (yes or no) as fixed effects. In total, 30\% of the neuropathic patients reported PHS in contrast to 2\% of healthy individuals. The frequency of PHS was not linked to the presence or intensity of pain. Paradoxical heat sensation was more frequent in patients living with polyneuropathy compared with central or unilateral peripheral nerve lesions. Patients who reported PHS demonstrated significantly lower sensitivity to thermal perception, with lower sensitivity to normally painful heat and cold stimuli. Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory scores were lower for burning and electric shock–like pain quality for patients with PHS. Our findings suggest that PHS is associated with loss of small thermosensory fibre function normally involved in cold and warm perception. Clinically, presence of PHS could help screening for loss of small fibre function as it is straightforward to measure or self-reported by patients.},

Standardized quantitative sensory testing was used in 902 (test cohort) and 233 (validation cohort) patients with peripheral neuropathic pain of different etiologies. For subgrouping, we performed a cluster analysis using 13 quantitative sensory testing parameters. Three distinct subgroups with characteristic sensory profiles were identified and replicated. Cluster 1 (sensory loss, 42\%) showed a loss of small and large fiber function in combination with paradoxical heat sensations. Cluster 2 (thermal hyperalgesia, 33\%) was characterized by preserved sensory functions in combination with heat and cold hyperalgesia and mild dynamic mechanical allodynia. Cluster 3 (mechanical hyperalgesia, 24\%) was characterized by a loss of small fiber function in combination with pinprick hyperalgesia and dynamic mechanical allodynia. All clusters occurred across etiologies but frequencies differed. We present a new approach of subgrouping patients with peripheral neuropathic pain of different etiologies according to intrinsic sensory profiles. These 3 profiles may be related to pathophysiological mechanisms and may be useful in clinical trial design to enrich the study population for treatment responders.},

Here, we investigated the effect of sensitization of heat-sensitive neurons on cold and warm integration. We examined thermal thresholds, PHS, and warm, cold, and pain sensations to alternating cold (10°C) and warm (40°C) bars (the thermal grill [TG]) in the primary area (application site) after topical application with capsaicin and vehicle control (ethanol) on the volar forearms in randomized order in 80 healthy participants. As expected, capsaicin induced heat allodynia and hyperalgesia and decreased cold and cold pain sensation. In addition, we found that after capsaicin application, the TG caused less pain and burning than the 40°C bars alone in contrast to the control side where the TG caused more pain and burning, consistent with the thermal grill illusion. In both situations, the pain intensity during the TG correlated inversely with both cold and warm pain thresholds but not with detection thresholds. Paradoxical heat sensation was only seen in 3 participants after control application but in 19 participants after capsaicin. Those with PHS after capsaicin application had higher detection thresholds to both cold and warm than those without PHS, but there was no difference in thermal pain threshold. These results suggest that a complex cross talk among several cold and warm sensitive pathways shapes thermal perception.},

	abstract = {Thermal perception relies not only on sensitivity but also on precision, yet the latter is often overlooked in clinical assessments. This study investigated how ageing and diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) affect both sensitivity (threshold) and precision (slope) in thermal perception, and whether these parameters can aid in differentiating patients from healthy controls. Using a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach, we estimated psychometric function thresholds and slopes for cold detection, warm detection, cold pain, and heat pain in 86 healthy adults (aged 20–80) and 34 patients with probable DPN. We assessed age- and neuropathy-related effects on these parameters and evaluated their utility in classifying patient status using simulated classification analyses. Ageing was associated with elevated thresholds in multiple thermal modalities and reduced precision specifically in cold detection. Patients with DPN showed higher detection thresholds and lower cold detection slopes, while pain-related parameters were largely unaffected. Classification based on cold and warm detection thresholds and slopes successfully discriminated patients from controls. However, pain-related parameters did not contribute meaningfully to classification. Residual correlations revealed xxx after accounting for age and neuropathy. These findings highlight the added value of assessing both sensitivity and precision in thermosensory testing. The assessment of precision may enhance the detection of early or subtle sensory dysfunction and improve diagnostic models for neuropathy and age-related decline.},
