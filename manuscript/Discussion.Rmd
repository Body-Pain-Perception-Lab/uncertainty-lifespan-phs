Paradoxical heat sensation (PHS) occurs when alternating warm and cool stimuli lead to a percept that is reported as warm [@hamalainen_paradoxical_1982; @susser_paradoxical_1999], yet previous research offers little insight into how individuals experience PHS. To achieve this, we developed and tested a computational model that jointly estimates the probability of reporting PHS and the associated perceptual uncertainty. Our model incorporates binary perceptual reports with response times and confidence ratings, allowing us to quantify PHS as a perceptual state shaped by thermal contrast, age-related changes, and individual differences in thermosensory processing. This extends beyond current psychophysical models that are able to estimate perceptual probability but do not account for uncertainty associated with the reported sensation. 

We formalised two perceptual profiles that differ in how uncertainty varies with the probability of PHS. In the true perceiver profile, uncertainty is lowest when the probability of PHS is near zero or one and peaks at the 50% threshold. This models PHS as an experience akin to true warmth perception. In the unsure perceiver profile, uncertainty increases with the probability of PHS and reaches its highest point when PHS is most likely. This models PHS as a perceptual state that remains ambiguous or unusual and might not clearly correspond to a perceptual category. At the group level, model comparisons showed the unsure perceiver profile provided a better fit, indicating that for most participants, PHS is associated with increased decisional uncertainty. This finding challenges the view that PHS is typically a clear but incorrect perception of warmth [@hamalainen_paradoxical_1982; @susser_paradoxical_1999] as, for many in our sample, PHS appears to be a perceptual state that may resemble warm perception but is accompanied by uncertainty about how to interpret it. This aligns with the idea that some illusory experiences reflect ambiguity in sensory processing rather than a categorical misperception. For example, similar patterns have been observed in other thermal illusions, such as the thermal grill, where sensations do not always map neatly onto established sensory labels [@deolindo_assessing_2025; @ehmsen_thermosensory_2025; @fardo_beyond_2020].

Group-level results based on the unsure perceiver model indicated that PHS probability increased with increasing thermal contrast, in line with previous results [@mitchell_thermal_2024]. In addition, older adults reported PHS more frequently and at lower levels of thermal contrast. Peak temperatures were individually calibrated to account for differences in thermal sensitivity, therefore this age-related increase in PHS cannot be explained by general sensory decline alone. Instead, it suggests that ageing affects how ambiguous thermal input is processed, independent of perceptual thresholds. This can be interpreted in light of previous work in individuals with spinal cord injury affecting thermosensory pathways [@defrin_sensory_2002]. In regions where only one thermal modality remained intact, the quality of non-painful thermal sensation was determined not by the stimulus itself, but by the preserved modality. For example, cold stimuli were perceived as warm in regions where only warm sensation was intact, and vice versa. These paradoxical percepts reflect cross-modality misattribution, in which noisy or absent sensory inputs from one modality are interpreted through the preserved modality. We propose that a similar process may be at play in healthy ageing. Ageing disproportionately affects cold sensitivity, with elevated detection thresholds and shallower psychometric slopes compared to warm detection [@courtin_perceiving_nodate]. Our results that older adults exhibited increased PHS rates and experienced PHS at lower thermal contrast levels, are consistent with the idea that weakened cold input leads to percept biased toward the warm modality [@davis_perceptual_2004]. In this view, PHS in ageing may represent a perceptual inference biased by the reliability of the most preserved thermal modality.
	
In addition to the group-level findings, we tested individual differences in PHS response. Although the majority were better described by the unsure perceiver profile, a subset of participants were better fit by the true perceiver profile, with similar distributions of the two profiles across age. These results indicate the presence of two distinct perceptual profiles highlighting that PHS does not represent a uniform perceptual experience across individuals. This pattern is consistent with findings from other sensory domains, where illusions often show substantial inter-individual variability, including in vision [@coren_individual_1987; @cretenoud_individual_2021] and multisensory illusions such as the rubber hand and other bodily illusions [@cutts_consistent_2019; @haans_individual_2012; @marotta_individual_2016]. Crucially, the distribution of these profiles was consistent across the lifespan, with no correlation between individual model fit and age. This indicates that the age-related increase in PHS is not explained by one perceptual profile becoming more common in older adults. The mechanism underlying the age effect reflects a general increase in the likelihood of the sensation occurring, rather than a change in how it is experienced. 

Finally, we identified 86% of participants to be PHS responders, with a subset of participants (11 out of 75) not reporting PHS under any condition. These individuals showed no indication of latent PHS responses, even at the highest levels of thermal contrast. This suggests that these participants experienced the stimuli as veridical cold, without generating the ambiguous percept characteristic of PHS. The absence of any behavioural markers indicative of subthreshold PHS, such as changes in response time or confidence, further supports this interpretation. These results indicate that approximately 15% of individuals may not experience paradoxical heat under the conditions tested.

Together, these results show that PHS is not a uniform perceptual phenomenon but varies both in whether it occurs and in how it is experienced across individuals. This variability, including the presence of non-responders, highlights the importance of modelling not only perceptual outcomes but also the uncertainty surrounding them. Our approach  provides a principled way to assess how changes in stimulus properties influence both the probability of a percept and its associated uncertainty. Although developed in the context of thermosensation, the method is applicable to a wide range of sensory and cognitive processes. It may be particularly relevant for more variable and bistable illusions, where modelling behavioural markers of uncertainty can offer new insights into both the nature of these experiences and sources of individual variability. More broadly, this framework has potential applications in clinical contexts, including conditions such as chronic or spontaneous pain, where altered perceptual uncertainty may contribute to the emergence or maintenance of symptoms.

### Strengths and Limitations
This study combined a computational model with a controlled experimental paradigm designed to quantify both the probability of PHS and the associated perceptual uncertainty. A key strength was the use of individually calibrated peak temperatures, which accounted for differences in thermal sensitivity across participants and age. This design ensured that age-related effects could be attributed to changes in perceptual processing rather than baseline differences in thermosensory detection thresholds. The large number of trials per participant also improved the reliability of parameter estimates and likely contributed to the high prevalence of PHS observed in this sample (~85%), which exceeds rates reported in previous studies [@schaldemose_longitudinal_2022; @schaldemose_it_2023].

Within our models, we have assumed conditional independence of the response variables (binary choices, response time and confidence ratings) and that any shared dependence is linked to thermal contrast and PHS probability. This simplifying assumption may overlook potential dependencies between measures that are not fully accounted for by the predictors, for example between the response variables themselves. Future work could address this limitation by adopting multivariate frameworks that explicitly model interdependencies among response variables, such as copula-based approaches [@klein_regression_2024; @yan_multivariate_2006]. Finally, whilst we are able to speculate on the mechanisms that might link ageing with increased PHS, our study does not include neurophysiological data (e.g., the degradation of cold input over the lifespan) that can directly support this interpretation. However, we have recently shown that cold perception is particularly susceptible to healthy ageing in the same sample of participants [@courtin_perceiving_nodate], providing support for our proposed mechanisms. Future research should focus on directly linking the thermosensory effects of ageing with changes to neurophysiology. 

### Conclusion
In this study, we applied a multivariate computational model to quantify the experience of an elusive thermosensory illusion, paradoxical heat sensation. The results show that PHS often reflects an ambiguous perceptual state rather than a clear misperception of warmth, with most participants exhibiting high uncertainty when PHS is most likely to occur. Older adults reported PHS more frequently and at lower thermal contrast levels, but this increase was not accompanied by changes in how the experience was qualitatively structured. The presence of two distinct perceptual profiles, consistent across age, demonstrates that PHS is not a uniform perceptual phenomenon but varies meaningfully across individuals in terms of certainty and interpretation. These findings advance the understanding of how ambiguous sensory input is processed and how uncertainty contributes to the experience of perceptual illusions. Critically, the model introduced here offers a general approach for investigating how uncertainty shapes perception, with applications extending beyond thermosensation to other forms of perceptual ambiguity, illusions, and clinical contexts involving altered perceptual experiences.
